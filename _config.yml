description: Hi, I am a senior at NYU studying Computer Science with a minor concentrating in the bsuiness of film.
I am particularly interested in the film and entertainment industry and the convergence between tech, VR, and media.
I've come across a few projects and creative labs that are newly founded and I hope to work with them and form a part of the transition to 5g and whatever else comes along within the entertainment industry.

A few fun facts: I am trilingual, I love tennis, my favorite movies are Inception, TAG, Lady Bird, & Good Will Hunting.
