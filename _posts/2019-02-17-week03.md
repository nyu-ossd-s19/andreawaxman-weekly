**Blog Post Week 3**

The browser extension my team created was very fun to make. My team communicated through group messenger, in addition to in-class meetups.
We each contributed our thoughts and ideas and had productive brainstorming conversations. The process was smooth as we agreed on many things and we all were on the same page and wanted to learn how to make the extension work.
I had never made an extension prior to this class so it was all a new experience that was fun and exciting. I hit a setback when I attempted to create a tag for adding sound to our app.
While it seemed pretty simple, I realized how important it is to be meticulous and if I can't figure it out myself, ask for help when needed.
My team was very supportive and had great code of conduct. In the end we were able to make a working useful browser extension and complete the project on time.
