**Kevin Fleming Talk**

My favorite part or most interesting part about the presentation Kevin Fleming gave was his emphasis on the usefulness of data mining and data science. He mentioned unstructured and structured data and applying algorithms to clean it and make use of apache Spark which happens to be open source! I am currently taking a Big Data Science course and it is refreshing to see it being applied in real (big) companies such as Bloomberg.
I found the part when he spoke about UX and the specific recruitment process they have for UX hires interesting and a little disappointing because he spoke about how they go straight to Carnegie Mellon to offer preference. I loved when he explained Netflix's chaos monkey (entropy tool) and spoke about the fun that comes with being employed to intentionally break clusters.

**Personal Progress (team project)**

While I unfortunately was not able to make it to our group meeting (which ended up being canceled) this week due to the Jewish holiday, I have been able to make more documentation contributions on my own. I visited my family in Mexico for Passover and was in the latin-speaking headspace so it was natural for me to add translations to the Material UI project right when I returned.
I feel good about the project and believe we are on the right track.
