**Speaker Presentation, Reflection**
Christos Bacharakis from Mozilla gave a cool and engaging presentation last week in class. Some things that caught my attention from his presentation were the function of Pocket by Firefox as well as the ‘Facebook Container’ feature that I wasn’t aware of previously. Furthermore, the Mozilla mission is very endearing and attractive of the company because it places trust and prioritizes the users before business. While I am still skeptical that this is totally true because large companies cannot really avoid monetizing and of course getting the best ROI, I appreciate that the mission and manifesto of Mozilla are aimed to benefit the general public before all else.

**Installation**
The installation instructions for the project were detailed and clear. I was able to install the dev environment easily, with a minor setback (updating the npm packages to latest version).
