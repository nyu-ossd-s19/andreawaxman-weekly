title: Week 2
---


I added audio (mp3) files to our project "tabi-clock." I attempted to change the json and html to add a tag to link the files so they play based on the time of day. The three files are a VO of me saying "good morning" "good afternoon" and "goodnight". The idea was to add the audio to the clock so it actually speaks to you when opening a new tab and based on the time whether it is morning, afternoon, or night, the message would speak accordingly.

Problems encountered:

I couldn't link the audio to the html. Will need to work on that.

Things learned:

We avoided merge conflicts by pulling each time we worked to keep our versions up to date and then worked. Team communication was most important here because we would let each other know when any change was added or when someone was about to commit changes. I learned which types of audio files were compatible with firefox and chrome and what appropriate tags are used for them.
