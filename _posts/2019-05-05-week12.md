**Updates**

The past two weeks have been a little hectic, with the holiday of Passover and all our finals and final projects coming in at once. Both Isaac and I (from my group) could not make it on Passover to our group meeting so it set the group back in the ideal timeline of progress we were hoping for. However, we are on track to present and show significant contributions and interaction with our chosen project Material-UI on time.

We have chosen new issues and have commented to check whether they are available and accessible for us -- which they are :).
While I originally thought the issue would be quite simple: adding new feature of 'size' property to the toggle button & toggle button group that they have made and experimented with in the 'material-ui lab' section in the repository, it is a bit more complicated.
Furthermore, as a team we are approaching this feature request from all possible angles and while we think the code is good to go to add the feature on the button, we can't test it properly from our computers so that is a setback because it means we cannot submit the PR and add documentation yet for something that is not merged (there).
This shall be solved by the end of the week and we may ask for more advice or help from the community to figure that part out and move on.
