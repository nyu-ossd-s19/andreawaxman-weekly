title: Week 4

A-Frame caught my attention because it is a JavaScript project who's use case is in VR and the film space. My passion and career path is in the niche world of film and tech and cs combining and I think this project is really cool and involved in that. I saw that Disney and Sony are some of their clients and that makes me want to contribute more. I have a passion for Disney projects and however I can get involved, through open source, film, or CS, I aim to get involved.

__Project Name: A-Frame__
__Project website:__ https://aframe.io/


__What is the purpose of the project:__ A-Frame handles the 3D and WebVR boilerplate required to get running across platforms including mobile, desktop, Vive, and Rift just by dropping in <a-scene>. So it provides features for VR that can be applied into objects across platforms, using simple HTML.


__How easy was it to find information about contributing on the website?__ Easy. There was a link to their GitHub on their website under "community" and on their README.md they included information on how to contribute. Moreover, there is a CONTRIBUTING.md file.

__How friendly is this project for beginner contributors?__

The actual project itself is not a beginner project. They don't label beginner friendly or documentation-centric issues and so there are no clear starting points for beginner contributors. However, they provide a very welcoming environment from what I've seen and are very responsive and welcome to new contributors.

__Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues?__

It looks like they do. The maintainers review, comment and close issues pretty quickly.

__Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat (for example, IRC or Slack)?__ Yes.


__Do pull requests get reviewed?__ Yes



__Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?__ Yes, sometimes.
