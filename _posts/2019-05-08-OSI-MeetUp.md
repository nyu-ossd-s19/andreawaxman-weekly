**Open Source (initiative) Meetup:**

Open source meetup 5/07/19
This blog post is about things I learned from attending the open source meetup held on May 7th, 2019.

The panelists, at least the ones I will refer to are professionals who now work in open source:

Their advice:
Use git.
Network! & get referrals. The most important thing to do when looking for a job is to network. Hiring teams or managers are people and most people prefer human interaction, putting a face to the name before trusting a piece of paper or a cold email.
Contributing doesn't need to be code. (learned this in class of course as well, they just reiterated it)
ALWAYS NEGOTIATE AND ASK FOR MORE IN THE BEGINNING WHEN YOU RECEIVE AN OFFER.
Software freedom conservancy.
Lots of lawyers involved. Something called “angel lawyers”
Briefly talked about/ introduced Google summer of code for those who don’t know.
& outreachy. Girl started at Whole Foods counter & graduated from outreachy & ended up at HP.

When looking to work on an open source project or a company:
Look at who they sponsor ie do they sponsor OSI?
Are people at these companies attending meetups? If not, maybe they’re restrictive hard to get in / high barrier of entry. 
I learned about: Copy left - as a great way to license something. (their advice: if you’re business is afraid of copy left, question it) Will they be using ur work. Proprietary?

Overall, I thought it was an excellent talk, I think we covered most of the topics in our OSSD class this semester, but it was cool to hear different perspectives and more people from the community who are interested in the topic speak about it. However, I did feel there was a bit of a stiffness toward capitalism, but perhaps it was just the way the discussion went.
